I forgot git basics so refreshing them here.
 

## Fun facts

- ".git" is a hidden folder which stores all of the files that contain all changes made in the history of this repository!

- git commit -m "Message" -m "Message description!"

- git commit -am "adds & commits all in a single command!!!"
